# Product Requirements Document: Simulation Analysis Tool

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the product requirements for the Simulation Analysis Tool, a Python script that simulates a dataset based on a linear equation, performs linear regression, and visualizes the results. The tool is designed to help users understand the relationship between a dependent and an independent variable, the effect of random noise on a linear relationship, and the use of linear regression to model data.

## 2. Goals and Objectives

*   To provide a tool for understanding the relationship between a dependent and an independent variable.
*   To visualize the effect of random noise on a linear relationship.
*   To demonstrate the use of linear regression to model data.

## 3. Features and Functionality

### 3.1. Data Generation

*   Generates a specified number of data samples.
*   Uses a configurable linear equation (`y = ax + b + r`) to generate data.
*   Allows for customization of the equation parameters (`a`, `b`) and the amount of random noise.

### 3.2. Linear Regression

*   Calculates the line of best fit for the generated data using the least squares method.

### 3.3. Visualization

*   Creates a scatter plot of the generated data.
*   Overlays the calculated regression line on the scatter plot.
*   Displays the data generation and regression equations in a text box on the plot.

### 3.4. Output

*   Saves the generated plot as a PNG image.
*   Saves the equations to a text file.

## 4. User Persona

Data analysts, students, and researchers who need to understand and visualize linear regression.

## 5. Technical Requirements

*   **Programming Language:** Python 3
*   **Libraries:** NumPy, Matplotlib

## 6. Assumptions and Dependencies

*   The user has a Python 3 environment with NumPy and Matplotlib installed.
*   The script assumes that the relationship between the variables is linear.

## 7. Future Enhancements

*   Allow the user to input the equation parameters and the number of samples through command-line arguments.
*   Support other types of regression (e.g., polynomial regression).
*   Provide more detailed statistical analysis of the results (e.g., R-squared value).
*   Create a graphical user interface (GUI) for interacting with the simulation.
